                Marijauna is a psychoactive drug used for both medical and recreational purposes.
                Current it is a schedule 1 drug in the United States. That means it is considered to be
                as dangerous as heroin and bath salts, has a high potential for abuse, and has no medical uses. 
                As such it is illegal in a majority of the United States and has a strong prejudice attached to it.
                This website seeks to change the public view of marijauna to have be viewed in a more positive light.

            content1= 'Marijuana has an interesting past due to its history of being both illegal and legal multiple times. Marijuana is produced from the cannabis plant. Another material produced from the cannabis plant is hemp. Hemp is made from the fibers of the plant and has been used to make a variety of products such as rope, cloth, clothes and paper. Hemp was one of the most important raw materials used during colonial America. In fact, in 1619 Virginia passed a law that required hemp to be grown on every farm in the colony. Additionally, in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, hemp was considered a form of currency. However, hemp lost its value when new products, such as cotton, were imported to the colonies. Hemp production had slowed down significantly by the end of the Civil War. However a different strain of the cannabis plant was on the rise. With the mass amounts of violence and gory injuries that occurred in the Civil War, a quick painkiller solution was needed. This is when marijuana became a prevalent ingredient in medicine and tinctures.'
            content2 = 'Marijuana stayed in medicine through the 1800s but did not make a major come back until the 1900s. In the 1910s, Mexican refugees fled to America during the Mexican Revolution and brought marijuana along with them. It became popular within the black jazz community but was outlawed during prohibition. When prohibition was repealed during the 1930s, the roots of the racism that dictate how our drug policies are carried out in the United States today took root. Bureaucrats began targeting Mexican and black communities and used marijuana as their reason to be racist. They argued that the drug was a threat to the country and therefore so were the people who used it. By 1931, twenty-nine states outlawed marijuana and in 1937 the plant itself was made illegal.'
            content3 = 'Since then, marijuana’s fate has been tossed around depending on the social issues at the time and the United States debt. The most notable event since 1970 was the “War on Drugs” in 1970 when marijuana was listed as a Schedule I drug. After years of research on medicinal benefits, California was the first state to legalize medicinal marijuana in 1996. Other states have gone through various stages of decriminalization and legalization. Washington D.C. and twenty-nine states have all legalized medicinal marijuana and ten states and Washington D.C. have legalized it recreationally. Though marijuana is still illegal under Federal law, the states have taken the power into their own hands and are enforcing their own laws. At this point in time, multiple states, such as New York, that have legalized marijuana medicinally, are heavily considering legalizing it recreationally. On a similar note, states that have decriminalized marijuana, such as Pennsylvania, have started to consider legalizing medicinal marijuana.'

Additionally, anyone living in the United States who enjoys partaking in cannabis consumption for recreational purposes should be interested in the government’s position on the topic. School-affiliated programs like D.A.R.E. are interested because they teach drug and substance abuse awareness and prevention to kids, so the legalization of a formerly illegal substance is important to note. Law enforcement is involved because they are the ones who make sure that people living in their respective jurisdictions follow the law, so they have to be up-to-date on the marijuana debate.'

So far there have been 0 deaths reported where the direct cause was marijuana and less than 300 deaths reported deaths where the suspected secondary cause was marijuana. Alcohol on the other hand has hundreds of thousands of deaths reported every year whether they be due to drunk driving, alcohol poisoning, or other accidents where alcohol was a suspected secondary cause. Over the long-term alcohol has also been proven to cause liver damage, permanent brain damage, increased risk for liver and mouth cancer, and various heart problems and diseases.'

Marijuana and the most common ways that it is consumed so far have not been proven to cause any kinds of cancer. Of course marijuana can have adverse long-term and short-term effects such as long-term memory and learning problems and bronchitis but compared to cigarettes the damage and risk is relatively low.'

By studying the effects of weed, we are able to uncover ailments for the drug that come with the less harmful side effects than the other drugs that are already on the market. Marijuana can be used as an effective form of pain relief for chronic pain because of its cannabinoids. These cannabinoids attach to the receptors in our brain and are extremely effective at fighting the pain attributed with extreme pain common with migraines or even the more serious things including AIDS. Not only can marijuana help us with physical pain, it has shown to be effective at helping with certain mental health issues by relieving the symptoms of depression, PTSD, and anxiety, and other common conditions. Even though the medicinal benefits of marijuana are undeniable, the prior infrastructure of the war on drugs is still evident and it is making it difficult to make it completely legal.Legalization would not only help people because of its medicinal purposes, it would boost the economy and help the government by flooding the system with tax dollars as well as adding thousands of jobs to the local economy. Cities like Pueblo, Colorado have seen economic spikes as big as $58 million and they have invested it heavily into the local infrastructure to help support and facilitate marijuana farming in the future. The fact that substantial economic benefits are being reaped already is astounding considering that the entire weed market is still in its infancy. Few states were brave enough to start the movement but now that a precedent has been set states will be following in the tracks of California, Colorado, Massachusetts, and other early adopters of medicinal and recreational marijuana. With the kinks currently being worked out, the market is only looking up and the early investors are already seeing payouts on a massive scale.'

            content1 = "On the 17th of October, Canada became the second country to legalize Marijuana. The legalization of Marijuana has been a pressing issue in today's world, and Canada is just the next country to act. The legalization allows adults “to buy, use, possess, and grow recreational marijuana under the law.” (Simon, Chavez) In Quebec and Alberta 18 is the legal age to use and buy marijuana, although, in the rest of the country the age it 19. This means that people above the age of 19, except in Alberta and Quebec, can go and purchase marijuana just like people above the age of 21 in America buy alcohol.You are probably wondering where you can purchase marijuana in Canada. Well, there are a few options: as of now, the number of shops in Canada is quite small, but is expected to grow within the next few years. The government in Canada is trying extremely hard to contain the sale of marijuana. They are moving forward with a “tightly regulated private retail model” (Higgins) that is scheduled to begin in April. Buying marijuana in Canada for people who reside outside of the country is a little tricky. Purchases of marijuana with a credit card require a Canadian credit card because most credit card companies won't clear cards to purchase marijuana.Besides purchasing in stores, there are online options. Purchasing online connects you with legal retailers and is then delivered to an address in Canada, with a signature from someone of legal age.While purchasing and using marijuana are legal, smoking it publically is a different story. Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario allow people above the legal age to consume marijuana “anywhere that it is legal to smoke tobacco, with the exception of cars and places where children are often present.” (Higgins) Although, in Manitoba, New Brunswick,  Newfoundland, and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon is it illegal to consume in public."

            content2 = "Since 1976, coffee shops in the Netherlands have been available for recreational use. This makes the Netherlands one of the older countries when it comes to being able to purchase marijuana. Most people around the world are under the misconception that marijuana is legal, although it isn’t. Marijuana in the Netherlands is actually decriminalized, which basically just means that it is tolerated. In the Netherlands nothing will happen if you go into a coffee shop (places in the Netherlands where people can purchase marijuana) to smoke or even to purchase marijuana for later, as long as it it 5 grams or less, you won’t have an issue. Although, the interesting thing is that growing marijuana in the Netherlands is illegal. So the people growing marijuana for coffee shops in the Netherlands are technically criminals and if caught will receive punishment.While in Amsterdam, if you are looking to use or purchase or consume marijuana, there are a few rules. Although smoking in coffeeshops in Amsterdam is tolerated, smoking publicly is in fact illegal. You are not allowed to roam the streets while smoking, you will either receive a warning, or in some cases a fine. You must be over the age of 18 to purchase marijuana in coffee shops, in some you have to be 21 years of age. Customers can only come in twice a day maximum to the same coffee shop and can no buy more than 5 grams a day."
